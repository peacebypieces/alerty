# Alerty the Discord Bot
This was my discord bot that I wrote in Python back in Spring 2021 during the Coronavirus Lockdown. I utilized Python and the discord.py library to create a bot that would ping my friends at certain times throughout the day on discord which was when we had zoom classes throughout the day. The bot was hosted on repl.it and was kept up by using a Flask web server that would use Uptime Robot to keep the web server alive.

As of May 2024, it no longer works as both the discord.py library has updated and Repl.it doesn't allow web servers to be hosted without a paid service.
